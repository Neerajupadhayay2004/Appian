## 🚀 Project Overview

**Case Compass** is an AI-powered, context-aware knowledge retrieval system designed for **enterprise case management environments**.
It helps support agents make **fast, accurate, and compliant decisions** by delivering **just-in-time policy guidance** directly within their workflow.

The system addresses a critical challenge faced by organizations handling **high-stakes cases** such as:

* Insurance claim processing
* Government benefit approvals
* Regulatory and compliance case handling

Instead of manually searching fragmented documents, agents receive **relevant policy clauses with verifiable citations**, reducing handling time and compliance risks.

## 🎯 Key Features

* **Context-Aware Knowledge Retrieval**
  Automatically analyzes active case data (e.g., claim type, jurisdiction) to fetch relevant information.

* **Just-in-Time Assistance**
  Proactively surfaces required policy clauses without manual search.

* **Verifiable Citations**
  Every AI-generated insight is linked to the exact document, page, and clause.

* **Workflow-Friendly UI**
  Designed to integrate seamlessly with enterprise case management systems.

* **Audit-Ready Outputs**
  Ensures transparency, traceability, and regulatory compliance.

## 🧠 System Architecture (High Level)

1. Case context extraction from active workflow
2. Semantic retrieval from indexed knowledge sources
3. AI reasoning using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
4. Citation mapping and compliance validation
5. Contextual response delivery to the agent interface
